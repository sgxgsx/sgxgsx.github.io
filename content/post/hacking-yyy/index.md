title: Bypassing SMS OTP Authentication or a story behind $16.5k in bounties
description: SMS OTPs are often seen as a secure authentication method, but what if they aren't? In this post, I break down how I reverse-engineered an OTP mechanism, leveraged probability theory, and achieved a 32% bypass success rateâ€”exposing weak PRNGs and poor OTP management along the way leading to a 100% bypass success rate

It's common to see SMS OTPs used for authentication, but bypassing them is not always trivial. In this post, we'll explore such an exploitation scenario by reverse engineering a black-box functionality, applying probability theory and analyzing entropy.

This is my first blog post ever, so I'd appreciate any feedback via any channel you find appropriate.
## Prologue

I discovered a simple PII disclosure vulnerability on an endpoint that returned customer data based on a provided phone number. The customer data included name, surname, email, phone number, full location, birth date, nationality, ID card or passport number. 

Example request:
```http
POST /retrieve-customer-data HTTP/2
Host: redacted.example.com

phonenumber=9999999
```

![Example of the leaked data](result.png)

The functionality was only there to autofill user forms. The team initially patched an issue straightforwardly by returning only a boolean value whether or not the phone number exists in the database, which I verified. 

However, three days later, developers reintroduced this feature with an additional security layer: requiring a user to provide an SMS OTP in order to retrieve data related to the phone number.

Sounds to be secure, but ...

## Exploiting Weak SMS OTP Implementations

Now, retrieving data required the following two requests: first requesting an OTP, then entering a 4-digit random OTP to retrieve the same data as before.

```http
POST /request-otp HTTP/2
Host: redacted.example.com

phonenumber=9999999
```

```http
POST /retrieve-customer-data HTTP/2
Host: redacted.example.com

phonenumber=9999999&otp=1111
```

The first things I thought about and tested were:
* Not sending an OTP
* Sending a `null` OTP
* Sending `0000` OTP
* Sending an OTP in different data types like arrays 
* Including both a body and query parameter for OTP
* Changing request method
* Changing content types and trying again with different data types
* Attempting to retrieve data without requesting an OTP

Eventually, I tested how many attempts we have before the OTP is invalidated by simply trying first sending one wrong request and then a right OTP, then two, then three wrong requests, and then I understood that the OTP is invalided on the 4th request to `/retrieve-customer-data`.

At this stage, guessing OTPs with a probability of 0.3% is already great, but can we do better?

Sure, while looking for a way to reset a counter of failed attempts, I have found that one can do this by requesting a new SMS message, which generates a new OTP, thus giving us three more attempts. In fact, we can only send 50 SMS messages for a phone number. Now, the setup is much better. 

If you take a look at a pseudo code I reverse-engineered for this feature, you probably might notice a problem.

```python
fail_count_map = dict()   ## 9999999 -> int
phone_to_otp = dict()     ## 9999999 -> list(int)/set(int)
phone_to_max_sms = dict() ## 9999999 -> int


def send_sms(phone_number):
	if phone_to_max_sms[phone_number] > 50:
		return 429_TO_MANY_SMS_MESSAGES_SENT
	OTP = generate_and_send_SMS_OTP()
	phone_to_otp[phone_number].append(OTP)
	fail_count_map[phone_number] = 0
	phone_to_max_sms[phone_number] = phone_to_max_sms[phone_number] + 1
	
def get_data(phone_number, otp):
	if otp in phone_to_otp[phone_number]:
		return GET_USER_DATA(phone_number)
	fail_count_map[phone_number] = fail_count_map[phone_number] + 1
	if fail_count_map[phone_number] > 3:
		# CLEAR OTPS

```

If you indeed noticed - congrats; if not, take a look at lines 2 and 15 - indeed SMS messages are not invalidated once we send a new one, they are simply kept in a structure similar to a set or list, thus each time we exceed our three `/retrieve-customer-data` requests and send a new `/request-otp` request we double our chances for the next three guesses.

For example:
* First 3 guesses with probabilities of 1/10000, 1/9999, 1/9998
* Next 3 guesses with probabilities of 2/9997, 2/9996, 2/9995
* Next 3 guesses with probabilities of 3/9994, 3/9993, 3/9992

After 50 OTP requests, the success rate reached ~**32%**.

Finally, a cherry on top - while testing, I accumulated a few thousand SMS messages, did a simple distribution fitting and found that the most frequent group was 7000-7150. For the PoC, I chose to guess this range and wrote the following Turbo Intruder script.

```
send_sms = """here goes your HTTP request"""

def queueRequests(target, wordlists):
    engine = RequestEngine(endpoint=target.endpoint,
                           concurrentConnections=5,
                           requestsPerConnection=100,
                           pipeline=False
                           )
    code = 7000
    for i in range(50):
        engine.queue(send_sms)
        time.sleep(2.0)
        for k in range(3):
            engine.queue(target.req, str(code))
            code += 1
    

def handleResponse(req, interesting):
    if req.status != 404:
        table.add(req)
```

The PoC worked 5 out of 5 times, which led to a conclusion that they might be using a non-cryptographically secure PRNG. It was just an educated guess, but later, the company confirmed that their provider used a non-cryptographically secure PRNG.



## Conclusion

Apart from basic takeaways such as checking for not invalidated OTPs or brainstorming and checking ideas, the following stood out for me:
* Block time somewhere in the future to verify fixes and find bypasses,  even if the fix was confirmed
* Try to "reverse engineer" the logic behind it and write it in code more often. I found it to be helpful to brainstorm further ideas.
* Don't forget about non-cryptographically secure PRNGs and check them more often. (distribution fitting, etc.)
