In cases with duplicate keys the second mapping takes precedence. \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; merged = {**obj1, **obj2} return {key: value for key, value in merged.items() if not isinstance(value, Omit)} Because extra_json takes precedence, we can overwrite the system parameter for Anthropic (or messages for OpenAI) and hijack execution flow. It’s a simple, vulnerable pattern with no obvious warning to developers who assume these are just “extra” parameters.\nTo exploit this vulnerability, two prerequisites must be met:\nAn adversary must be able to set an arbitrary key and value—mass assignment via GET/POST parameters, headers, or cookies works well. To affect an end user, an attacker must also be able to set those keys on the user’s behalf—again via GET/POST parameters, redirects, or postMessage calls. Impact varies widely. If attackers can set keys on behalf of end users, or if the agent exposes dangerous tools that execute code or leak data, the risk skyrockets.\nFor example, in the sample code which you reviewed, the agent exposes a call function that executes shell commands. Once an attacker replaces the system prompt that forbids calling it, remote code execution is possible.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 { \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;function\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;function\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;call\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;description\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Executes a shell command and returns the output or an error message.\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;strict\u0026#34;: True, \u0026#34;parameters\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;object\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;required\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;code\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;properties\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;code\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;string\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;description\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;The shell command to execute.\u0026#34; } }, \u0026#34;additionalProperties\u0026#34;: False } } } The chances of encountering this pattern are relatively low, as it\u0026rsquo;s not a common use of the API. However, I\u0026rsquo;ve come across a few codebases that let users supply custom extra keys and values. It\u0026rsquo;s only a matter of time before an application emerges that enables an attacker to exploit this behaviour from source to sink.\nReal code from GitHub: Safe vs. Unsafe I searched GitHub for projects that use extra_body, ignoring pure CLI apps. Few people share full web-integrated agents, but these two snippets illustrate good and bad practice:\nSafe approach — AstrBot validates every key before merging.\nhttps://github.com/AstrBotDevs/AstrBot/blob/9147cab75bacf5d7f81548d8b209faac13a77d32/astrbot/core/provider/sources/openai_source.py#L103\u0026hellip; Unsafe approach — MaxKB merges everything without filtering.\nhttps://github.com/1Panel-dev/MaxKB/blob/7ce66a7bf3ddf123a648e23db920eeaeb00cbe42/apps/setting/models_provider/base_model_provider.py#L109\u0026hellip; How to fix it Whitelist keys you accept; reject the rest. Strip unknown keys if you cannot whitelist. Treat extra_body as untrusted input.

There are no privacy implications - unless you pasted personal data into the chat itself, which OpenAI discourages.\nHowever, on 16th April 2025 OpenAI rolled out two new reasoning models, o3 and o4-mini, that unexpectedly leaked the profile name associated with your OpenAI account.\nThe leak was model-side, not user-side: the model echoed the name inside its hidden “thoughts” panel, so the disclosure went unnoticed unless someone expanded that view.\nExample Someone posted a share link on X/Twitter (account and URL redacted for privacy):\nOpening the link shows the banner “This is a copy of a conversation between ChatGPT \u0026amp; Anonymous.”\nBut after opening Thought for 6 seconds, you can see the user’s first name - Artem:\nWhy the name leaked At inference time the model appears to have had access to an internal variable (likely via an API call) that contained the user’s display name. That variable was reflected into the chain-of-thought. Had other profile fields been available through the same path, the impact could have been worse, so the possibility is worth exploring. Practical risk There is no risk unless you want to remain as anonymous as advertised:\nIf you shared a chat with o3 or o4-mini between 16 - 18 April 2025 and care about anonymity, delete the link. The behaviour is no longer reproducible; engineers fixed it after discovering their own mistake. Final Thoughts When it comes to reporting AI related bugs especially one really needs to clearly define the impact (even that might not be helpful) because as Joseph Thacker said:\n“Many AI vulnerabilities are dismissed because their real-world impact is unclear. Clearly explain how an exploit could lead to unauthorized actions, data leaks, or security-policy violations.”\nTimeline 16 Apr 2025 20:11 UTC – reported. 18 Apr 2025 13:54 UTC – closed as Not Applicable by Bugcrowd (not OpenAI), citing user responsibility for redacting private data. 18 Apr 2025 – Patch only for new chats deployed (unknown source and time) 21 Apr 2025 - closed again as N/A 21 Apr 2025 - Asked for OpenAI team response 30 Apr 2025 - Asked for OpenAI team response 15 May 2025 - Disclosed P.S.

We have a domain that reflects the value of the request\u0026rsquo;s Origin header into the Access-Control-Allow-Origin response header. In addition to that, the endpoint returns the following headers:\n1 2 3 4 5 Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://evil.com Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Accept, Authorization, Cache-Control, Content-Type, Origin, Pragma, X-Api-Authorization, X-Cache-For, X-CSRF-Token, X-HTTP-Method-Override, X-Requested-With, Adrum, X-Add-Attributes, X-Add-Headers, X-Force-Accept-Language, X-Referer Access-Control-Expose-Headers: Content-Length, Content-Location, Content-Range, Content-Type, Link, Last-Modified, Location, X-CSRF-Token, X-Enabled, X-Linguist-Hash Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, OPTIONS, HEAD, PATCH, DELETE In general, if Access-Control-Allow-Origin is set to a specific domain and Access-Control-Allow-Credentials is set to true, then the website trusts this domain to carry out requests on behalf of the user (the browser includes user\u0026rsquo;s cookies). For detailed information about CORS, refer to web.dev or Portswigger\nUnexploitable CORS At first, I created a quick Proof of Concept and tested it, but unfortunately, the browser didn’t send any cookies. Why?\nThe answer lies in how the authentication cookies were set. I examined the endpoint responsible for setting the cookie and it had the following attributes:\nThe SameSite=Lax attribute basically means that the authentication cookie is only sent when the request originates from a same-site context, with a few exceptions:\nLax+POST (2-minute window when the cookie is first set) – Not applicable here, as we are trying to exploit CORS, and the target uses CSRF tokens to protect against CSRF attacks. Additionally, the SameSite flag is explicitly set, preventing Lax+POST from working. Top-level navigation – Again, this does not help since we are trying to exploit CORS. This is likely the point where many researchers gave up. However, there was still a way to exploit the issue - just not from an arbitrary domain. Instead, we needed access to a subdomain under the same site (.swisscom.ch).\nFinding an XSS vulnerability would typically require giving up a bounty or spending an unknown amount of time searching for one. Instead, I focused on something every security professional loves - out-of-scope assets.\nChaining the Exploit with XSS Fortunately, Swisscom has customer subdomains under .cust.swisscom.com. With the help of Google Dork magic I identified an XSS within two minutes on the following site:\n1 site:cust.swisscom.ch inurl:search With this, exploitation became straightforward:\nGet a user to visit our controlled subdomain. Send a POST request to the vulnerable XSS endpoint. Inject JavaScript via XSS to send CORS requests and extract user data. Profit. Now, we could query all available user data from the target system.\nCSRF Exposure Another crucial observation: the Access-Control-Expose-Headers list included X-CSRF-Token, which meant we could retrieve the user’s CSRF token. This allowed not only data exfiltration but also modifying data via POST, PATCH, and DELETE requests. In the end if the adversary happenned to attack a user with an Admin or SuperUser role they could leverage the CSRF to perform Account Takeovers via api/sc/set-email.\nA Wormable Exploit An interesting aspect of this platform is its wormable properties when it comes to client-side issues like XSS. Users on the platform could chat with each other, and through CORS and CSRF exploitation, the payload could propagate itself across accounts.\nFinal Thoughts Thinking beyond constraints and getting back to fundamentals is rather an important skill to hone. These approaches can lead to identifying something fairly simple lying on the surface which everyone else has overlooked.\nTimeline 27.01.2025 - Issue reported 29.01.2025 - Issue triaged 07.02.2025 - Issue fixed 07.02.2025 - Fix verified ??.??.???? - Awaiting bounty decision ","date":"2025-02-24T00:00:00Z","image":"https://blog.ys0.dev/p/cors-csrf-swisscom-attack/cover-cors_hu_8abb7780018160d6.jpeg","permalink":"https://blog.ys0.dev/p/cors-csrf-swisscom-attack/","title":"Overlooked CORS Misconfiguration led to CSRF on Core Asset of Swisscom"},{"content":"It\u0026rsquo;s common to see SMS OTPs used for authentication, but bypassing them is not always trivial. In this post, we\u0026rsquo;ll explore such an exploitation scenario by reverse engineering a black-box functionality, applying probability theory and analyzing entropy.\nThis is my first blog post ever, so I\u0026rsquo;d appreciate any feedback via any channel you find appropriate.\nPrologue I discovered a simple PII disclosure vulnerability on an endpoint that returned customer data based on a provided phone number. The customer data included name, surname, email, phone number, full location, birth date, nationality, ID card or passport number.\nExample request:\n1 2 3 4 POST /retrieve-customer-data HTTP/2 Host: redacted.example.com phonenumber=9999999 The functionality was only there to autofill user forms. The team initially patched an issue straightforwardly by returning only a boolean value whether or not the phone number exists in the database, which I verified.\nHowever, three days later, developers reintroduced this feature with an additional security layer: requiring a user to provide an SMS OTP in order to retrieve data related to the phone number.\nSounds to be secure, but \u0026hellip;\nExploiting Weak SMS OTP Implementations Now, retrieving data required the following two requests: first requesting an OTP, then entering a 4-digit random OTP to retrieve the same data as before.\n1 2 3 4 POST /request-otp HTTP/2 Host: redacted.example.com phonenumber=9999999 1 2 3 4 POST /retrieve-customer-data HTTP/2 Host: redacted.example.com phonenumber=9999999\u0026amp;otp=1111 The first things I thought about and tested were:\nNot sending an OTP Sending a null OTP Sending 0000 OTP Sending an OTP in different data types like arrays Including both a body and query parameter for OTP Changing request method Changing content types and trying again with different data types Attempting to retrieve data without requesting an OTP Eventually, I tested how many attempts we have before the OTP is invalidated by simply trying first sending one wrong request and then a right OTP, then two, then three wrong requests, and then I understood that the OTP is invalided on the 4th request to /retrieve-customer-data.\nAt this stage, guessing OTPs with a probability of 0.3% is already great, but can we do better?\nSure, while looking for a way to reset a counter of failed attempts, I have found that one can do this by requesting a new SMS message, which generates a new OTP, thus giving us three more attempts. In fact, we can only send 50 SMS messages for a phone number. Now, the setup is much better.\nIf you take a look at a pseudo code I reverse-engineered for this feature, you probably might notice a problem.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 fail_count_map = dict() ## 9999999 -\u0026gt; int phone_to_otp = dict() ## 9999999 -\u0026gt; list(int)/set(int) phone_to_max_sms = dict() ## 9999999 -\u0026gt; int def send_sms(phone_number): if phone_to_max_sms[phone_number] \u0026gt; 50: return 429_TO_MANY_SMS_MESSAGES_SENT OTP = generate_and_send_SMS_OTP() phone_to_otp[phone_number].append(OTP) fail_count_map[phone_number] = 0 phone_to_max_sms[phone_number] = phone_to_max_sms[phone_number] + 1 def get_data(phone_number, otp): if otp in phone_to_otp[phone_number]: return GET_USER_DATA(phone_number) fail_count_map[phone_number] = fail_count_map[phone_number] + 1 if fail_count_map[phone_number] \u0026gt; 3: # CLEAR OTPS If you indeed noticed - congrats; if not, take a look at lines 2 and 15 - indeed SMS messages are not invalidated once we send a new one, they are simply kept in a structure similar to a set or list, thus each time we exceed our three /retrieve-customer-data requests and send a new /request-otp request we double our chances for the next three guesses.\nFor example:\nFirst 3 guesses with probabilities of 1/10000, 1/9999, 1/9998 Next 3 guesses with probabilities of 2/9997, 2/9996, 2/9995 Next 3 guesses with probabilities of 3/9994, 3/9993, 3/9992 After 50 OTP requests, the success rate reached ~32%.\nFinally, a cherry on top - while testing, I accumulated a few thousand SMS messages, did a simple distribution fitting and found that the most frequent group was 7000-7150. For the PoC, I chose to guess this range and wrote the following Turbo Intruder script.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 send_sms = \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34;here goes your HTTP request\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; def queueRequests(target, wordlists): engine = RequestEngine(endpoint=target.endpoint, concurrentConnections=5, requestsPerConnection=100, pipeline=False ) code = 7000 for i in range(50): engine.queue(send_sms) time.sleep(2.0) for k in range(3): engine.queue(target.req, str(code)) code += 1 def handleResponse(req, interesting): if req.status != 404: table.add(req) The PoC worked 5 out of 5 times, which led to a conclusion that they might be using a non-cryptographically secure PRNG. It was just an educated guess, but later, the company confirmed that their provider used a non-cryptographically secure PRNG.\nConclusion Apart from basic takeaways such as checking for not invalidated OTPs or brainstorming and checking ideas, the following stood out for me:\nBlock time somewhere in the future to verify fixes and find bypasses, even if the fix was confirmed Try to \u0026ldquo;reverse engineer\u0026rdquo; the logic behind it and write it in code more often. I found it to be helpful to brainstorm further ideas. Don\u0026rsquo;t forget about non-cryptographically secure PRNGs and check them more often.
